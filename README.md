Hello there,

My name is David, I integrate new and established technologies in robotics and IoT, with a proven track record of implementing innovative solutions to complex challenges.

At Brisa Robótica, which I co-founded, I led efforts to transform non-autonomous machines into an autonomous fleet, while at Synapticon, I developed software stacks for an autonomous lawnmower and scalable test infrastructure for embedded systems.

As a highly adaptable and anti-fragile professional, I thrive in challenging environments and excel at finding creative solutions to complex problems.

Beyond work, I relish immersing in nature and the vibrant Jewish community of [Eimsbüttel](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Eimsb%C3%BCttel). Hiking in nearby forests, community events, and cooking traditional Moroccan Jewish food bring me great joy. I enjoy practicing languages and sharing these experiences with others, including my Ashkenazi friends. Connecting our diverse backgrounds under the same religion is an amazing way to learn about different cultures while indulging my love of food and language.
