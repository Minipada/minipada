Hello there,

I'm leading the development for many of our stacks at Brisa Robotics. Nowadays, working on systems, backend, frontend and analytics.

At [Brisa Robotics](https://www.brisa.tech/), we developped Windrose, a suite of tools to make MHE and robots autonomous in days instead of weeks:
1. An optimized localization and navigation modules connected to your MES/WMS
2. A KIT to make the vehicle autonomous that can be installed in hours
3. A reliable and secure operating system
4. Analytics and alerting available everywhere to predict and understand your efficiency

The company is in Recife, Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· while I live in Hamburg, Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª. We already completed installations remotely in Brazil and Europe.

Ping be at my email for more material or for a digital coffee.

Cheers!
