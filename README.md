Hello there,

My name is [David Bensoussan](https://twitter.com/d__bensoussan) and I'm a software engineer from France currently residing in Hamburg, Germany.

I love robotics and IoT, exploring new and established technologies in these fields. I have a strong track record of implementing innovative solutions to complex challenges.

At [Brisa Robótica](https://www.linkedin.com/company/11711423), which I co-founded in Brazil, I led efforts to transform non-autonomous machines into an autonomous fleet. And at [Synapticon](https://www.linkedin.com/company/synapticon-gmbh/), I worked on developing software stacks for an autonomous lawnmower and creating a scalable test infrastructure for embedded systems.

I thrive in challenging environments and am highly adaptable and anti-fragile. I love finding creative solutions to complex problems and am always eager to take on new challenges.

Beyond work, I relish immersing in nature and the vibrant Jewish community of [Eimsbüttel](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Eimsb%C3%BCttel). Hiking in nearby forests, community events, and cooking traditional Moroccan Jewish food bring me great joy. I enjoy practicing languages and sharing these experiences with others, including my Ashkenazi friends. Connecting our diverse backgrounds under the same religion is an amazing way to learn about different cultures while indulging my love of food and language.
